## Download
<b>KNOWN ISSUE: Windows Defender will sometimes flag the download as a virus. This is because of Program:Win32/Wacapew.C!ml, a system used to help compile the program with PyInstaller. It is a false postive. I am actively trying to fix this. For now, you can either allowed the
program to run via Windows Defender settings or download the src and run the program from there</b>
